    <h2><u>A Little About Myself:</u></h2>
      <p>My name is Josephine and I'm going to be a junior at Ingraham High School this fall. I'm from Seattle and am a student in the Adobe Summer Immersion Program here. I am super excited to be learning all about coding, since I'm a beginner. I've had a lot of fun so far!</p>
